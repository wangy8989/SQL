# SQL projects
This folder contains 2 sql projects in python.
## Project 1  
We use bigquery and public Austin bike share dataset from Google cloud to build a linear regression model to predict the number of rides based on the station where the trip starts and the hour when the trip started. The result shows our model performs badly, having a negative R squared.  
## Project 2  
In this project, we analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. We are going to find the answers to some questions in this dataset.
